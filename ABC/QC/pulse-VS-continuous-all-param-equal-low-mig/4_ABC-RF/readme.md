# Model choice with ABC RF

[This R script](20210521_ABC_RF_scenario-1a_2migrationmodels_constant_parameters.R) contains the different step of the model choice procedure with ABC-RF, where the two models are of topology 1a, with pulse versus continuous migration. It is given as an example. The same analysis was performed for the other seven topologies. There are slight differences in which summary statistics are constant (and hence are removed from the analysis) for the different topologies (though the bulk is the same).
