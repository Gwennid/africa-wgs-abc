- [ ] Find the script that I run once all the fsc simulations are done, to obtain the file with 382 sumstats. It might be one or several scripts. It should deal with unsucessful simulations and with taking proportions for some of the statistics. I found a script that does that (ABC_simul_Second_trial_make_reference_tables.sh) but it is very messy, and I am quite sure that I can find something better! (e.g. for continuous models, or QC)
