# Six migration modalities per topology

For this analysis, we performed model choice, for each topology, among the six migration modalities. We did not generate new simulation data but used a subset of the data generated for the main analysis [here](../../fsc-simulations/).

- [ ] I did less polishing than [here](pulse-VS-continuous-all-param-equal-low-mig) (e.g. the R script for making the plots contains the commands for the eight topologies). Think whether it should be more polished.
