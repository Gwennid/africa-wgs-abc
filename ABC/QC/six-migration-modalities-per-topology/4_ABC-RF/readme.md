# Model choice with ABC RF

[This R script](REPLACE) contains the different steps of the model choice procedure with ABC-RF, where the six models are of topology 1a. It is given as an example. The same analysis was performed for the other seven topologies.

The outputs of the script fall into two categories: QC (e.g. PCA of the summary statistics, goodness-of-fit, information relative to the ABC-RF procedure) and the model choice results: confusion matrices (see an [example](REPLACE)) and votes. The latter two outputs are plotted using [this script](REPLACE). The ABC-RF result plots are shown [here](../5_ABC-RF-result-plots).
