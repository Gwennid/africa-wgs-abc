# QC ABC

We performed checks at various stages of our ABC analyses. In this folder we gathered files relevant to testing different aspects of our ABC framework.
The files used to validate the main results of the article (for example test inherent to the ABC-RF model choice procedure) can be found in the folders corresponding to the analyses in question, one level up.

The following QC were performed:

## Does the set of genetic windows the summary statistics are computed on matter?

We compared three sets of windows.

## Do the pulse and continuous models give similar results when all non-migration parameters are identical and migration rates are very low?

[Code](pulse-VS-continuous-all-param-equal-low-mig)

## Do the results of model choice between pulse and continuous migration for each topology match the results across topologies?

[Code](six-migration-modalities-per-topology)
